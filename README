I know that this isn't a macro and I haven't used it in a while but I always have people emailing me about it so I figured I'd try putting it up here.
The header file has instructions for adding it to the vim project.  Anyone is more than welcome to pick/clean this up.  Usage is
straight forward and there is latent ( read: not working ) support for setting breakpoints from vim.  
I wrote this a while ago so it's not a stellar example of using ATL etc.

Usage:  :vc <cmd>
where <cmd> is any exported command in Visual Studio.  See the keybindings to see all of the different commands.

It's also available at my web page as well as other vim stuff
